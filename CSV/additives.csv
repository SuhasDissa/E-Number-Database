 People with intolerance to salicylates may also find that they are intolerant to E180, because the coloration is an azo dye.  E180 can also worsen asthma and have a negative effect on those who suffer from rhinitis or hives from skin disease. Possible hyperactivity in children. 
 In large doses it is a histamine releaser and can increase the symptoms of asthma and produce eczema, hives and insomnia.     Because it is an azo dye it can cause intolerance  in people allergic to salicylic acid.",Colours,Halal
